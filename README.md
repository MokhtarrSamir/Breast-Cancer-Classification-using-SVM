# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-SVM
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on real medical data. The model includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.

Dataset
    Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
    Features include cell nuclei characteristics

Target classes:
    Malignant (Cancerous)
    Benign (Non-cancerous)

Technologies Used:
    1.Python
    2.Jupyter Notebook
    3.Scikit-learn
    4.Pandas
    5.NumPy
    6.Matplotlib

Project Workflow:
    1.Data loading and exploration
    2.Handling missing values
    3.Feature scaling
    4.Splitting data into training and testing sets
    5.Training SVM classifier
    6.Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)

Results
    The model achieved high classification accuracy in detecting breast cancer.
    Model Accuracy: 92%
